Streaming isn't that bad when you're too lazy to download a complete serie. Plus, 'Matcha' offer you a new experience !

What's an userstyle ?
-------------------------------

Simply put, it's a script with a bunch of pseudo-code that will change the aspect of any website, it's kind like make-up I guess : you'll be able to change/modify the visual of the elements of the page (background, icon, buttons, etc...) and even delete some useless stuff. To use it, there is an add-on called 'Stylish' for the majority of the browser, so if you are on Chrome, Firefox, Opera and such go for it ! I also recommend you to go to userstyles.org (userstyles.org/) where you can found a lot of styles for a lot of website.

What do 'Matcha' change ? 
-------------------------------

First of all it removes the fucking green who kills your eyes (at least for me), wanted to do a flat interface, add some transitions to add a bit of dynamism, there aren't any drastic modification in the functionality of the site tho ! Add a banner and a new logo which give a more modern look, you'll able to change them if they don't suite your taste.

How to install it ?
-------------------------------
After installing 'Stylish', you'll have to 'write a new style', copy/paste the code in 'Matcha (WITHOUT ADBLOCK).css' or 'Matcha (WITH ADBLOCK), name the style and then save ! Before installing it, I suggest you :

- to install the font I used, namely 'Roboto' (www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/rob…), don't worry it's free as fuck.
- download Adblock Plus to kill the ads, but since Kissanime doesn't allow it you have to download Greasemonkey (for Mozilla) or Tampermonkey (for Google Chrome), and you will have to install the script 'Anti AdBlock Killer' (github.com/reek/anti-adblock-k…). 

Where can I find your works ?
-------------------------------
I have a deviantart page : nicknameisfortheweak.deviantart.com, I also submit my script in pastebin : http://pastebin.com/u/Catgrills

And that's it, I hope you'll enjoy this script if you see this submission ! Like usual, if you have find the script cool or bad, if you have questions, suggestions, there is a section called 'Comments', you can use it everytime !
