About
-------------------------------

Matcha-V is a custom stylesheet for kissanime.

A custom stylesheet (or userstyles) is a script with a bunch of pseudo-code that will change the aspect of any website, it's kind like make-up I guess : you'll be able to change/modify the visual of the elements of the page (background, icon, buttons, etc...) and even delete some useless stuff.


Instruction
-------------------------------

<strong>Step 1 : Install Stylish</strong>

<span>Depending of your browser.</span>
<ol>
<li>for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>
<li>for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en">Google Chrome</a></li>
<li>for <a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylish/">Opera</a></li>
<li>for <a href="http://sobolev.us/stylish/">Safari</a></li>
<li> for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.pmmlabs.stylish&amp;hl=en">Dolphin</a></li>
</ol>

<strong>Step 2 : Install the script </strong>
<ol>
<li> Via <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/144798/matcha-v-ka-css">userstyles</a> : click the button <i>install Style</i> and it's done.</li>
<li> Or <a href="https://pastebin.com/AqGYzCfx">manually</a> : create a new style in Stylish and copy/paste the script in it. The script was written for Firefox Mozilla, that's why for Google Chrome and such, you'll have to click the button <i>Import from Mozilla.</i></li>
</ol>

<strong>Step 3 : Install the font </strong>

I use several fonts for my custom stylesheet.
<ol>
<li> <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto">Roboto</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://www.freejapanesefont.com/bokutachi-gothic-2-bold/">Bokutachi no Gothic 2 </a></li>
</ol>

<strong>Step 4 : Show your appreciation </strong>
<ol>
<li>Feel free to comment this submission (critique, suggestion, compliment, etc).</li>
<li>If you like my works, don't hesitate to watch me.</li>
<li>You can share it, but don't forget to mention me.</li>
</ol>

Trivia
-------------------------------

I decided to name the script <i>Matcha-V</i> because I drink a lot of tea and the green of the original layout of Kissanime made me think of Matcha, thus Matcha. The <i>V</i> comes from Vert, which means green in French, but I put this because it sounds cool to be honest, and to differenciate it with my previous kissanime script called <i>Matcha</i>.


Report
-------------------------------

If you find some elements that weren't tweaked or that you simply want to modify or re-add an element that was removed, don't hesitate to report it in the comments.
